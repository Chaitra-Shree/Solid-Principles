// Separation of Concerns (SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections,
// such that each section addresses a separate concern.
// A concern is a set of information that affects the code of a computer program.
// By separating concerns, you improve the modularity of the code, making it easier to develop, maintain, and scale.

    1. Database operations
    2. Business logic
